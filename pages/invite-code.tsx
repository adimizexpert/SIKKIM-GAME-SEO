        <h2>Invitation Code vs Referral Code</h2>
        <p>
          Invitation code and referral code are often used interchangeably:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Invitation Code:</strong> Used during registration to join the platform. You need someone else's code to register.</li>
          <li><strong>Referral Code:</strong> Your unique code to invite others after you're registered. You share this code with others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Both terms refer to the same concept - a code used to link registrations and provide bonuses. 
          The standard code 384636381064 can be used as either an invitation code (for new users) or as a referral code (when shared by users).
