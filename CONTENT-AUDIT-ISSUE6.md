# Issue 6 – Content quality: “Crawled but not indexed” pages

Target: **300+ words of genuine body content** per page so Google is more likely to index them.

---

## 1. `/about-sikkim-game`

**Current body content (approx.):** ~380 words  
- Intro, Our Mission, What We Offer (with 4 bullets), Why Choose Us, Our Commitment to Fairness, Join Our Growing Community, Disclaimer.

**Verdict:** Already at/above 300 words. Optional: add 1–2 sentences on “How to get started” (link to register/download) to reinforce usefulness.

---

## 2. `/privacy`

**Current body content (approx.):** ~480 words  
- 10 sections: intro, Information We Collect, How We Use, Sharing, Data Security, Cookies, Your Rights, Data Retention, Children’s Privacy, Changes, Contact.

**Verdict:** Already substantive. No change required for length. Keep “Last Updated” and contact link.

---

## 3. `/contact`

**Current body content (approx.):** ~220 words  
- H1 + subheading, 3 contact methods (Email, Live Chat, WhatsApp), 3 “Common Issues” blurbs. Rest is form labels/UI.

**Gap:** ~80–100 words to reach 300+.

**Suggested additions (place after “Get in Touch” or before “Common Issues”):**

- **“When to contact us”** (2–3 sentences): e.g. “Contact us for login or registration issues, withdrawal or KYC delays, bonus or gift code questions, or technical problems with the app. We aim to reply within 24 hours on business days.”
- **“Before you write”** (1–2 sentences): “For faster answers, check our [FAQ](/faqs) and [login](/login) or [withdrawal](/withdrawal) guides.”

That adds ~50–80 words; total body will exceed 300.

---

## 4. `/faqs`

**Current body content (approx.):**  
- Visible body (H1 + subheading + CTAs): ~40 words.  
- FAQ answers (in accordions): 1,500+ words, but engines may treat “body” and “accordion” differently.

**Gap:** Risk of “thin” if only the short intro is counted. Add **80–120 words of intro** before the first CTA.

**Suggested addition (after subheading, before first CTA):**

- 2–3 short paragraphs: what Sikkim Game is, that the page covers login/register, bonuses, withdrawals, safety, and legal; and that answers are kept up to date. Link to [Register](/register), [Login](/login), [Guide](/guide).

Example (≈90 words):

> Sikkim Game is an online prediction and gaming platform where you can play WinGo, Aviator, and Big-Small. Below you’ll find answers to the most common questions about creating an account, logging in, claiming bonuses and gift codes, withdrawals, and safety.
>
> We update these answers regularly. If you don’t see your question, use our [contact form](/contact) or check the [step-by-step guide](/guide) and [login](/login) or [register](/register) pages.

## Summary

| Page                 | Est. body words | At 300+? | Action                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `/about-sikkim-game` | ~380            | Yes      | Optional 1–2 sentences “get started”         |
| `/privacy`           | ~480            | Yes      | None                                        |
| `/contact`           | ~220            | No       | Add “When to contact” + “Before you write”  |
| `/faqs`              | ~40 (visible)   | No       | Add 80–120 word intro before first CTA     |

Implementing the **contact** and **faqs** additions will give both pages 300+ words of clear, useful content and should help with “crawled but not indexed.”
